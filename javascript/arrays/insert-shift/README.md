## Approach & Efficiency

1. Calculate the middle index: Determine the middle index of the array. In this case, it's the index where the new value will be inserted to maintain the sorted order.
2. Shift elements to the right: Starting from the middle index, shift each element to the right to make space for the new value. This ensures that no elements are overwritten during the insertion process.
3. Insert the new value: Once there is enough space created by shifting elements, insert the new value at the calculated middle index.
4. Final array: After inserting the new value, the array is sorted with the new value in its correct position.
