# Data Structures and Algorithms

## Overview
This repository contains implementations for various data structures and algorithms. Each language-specific implementation can be found in its respective directory.

## Projects
### Tree Intersection
This project involves creating a function `tree_intersection` that takes two binary trees and returns the set of intersecting values using a Hashmap.

#### Structure
- **C#**: Located in `TreeIntersection.cs`
- **JavaScript**: Located in `treeIntersection/tree-intersection.js`
- **Python**: Located in `tree_intersection/tree_intersection.py`
- **Java**: Located in `TreeIntersection/TreeIntersection.java`

#### Running Tests
Instructions on how to run tests for each implementation.
